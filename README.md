This is my little Firefox CSS collection included with my [nix-config](https://github.com/mimvoid/nix-config)!

Start page is [Tabliss](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/).

Special thanks to [MrOtherGuy](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy) for the very helpful tutorials and [css code](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks).
