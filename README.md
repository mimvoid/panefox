This is my little Firefox CSS config included within my [NixOS and Home Manager configuration](https://github.com/mimvoid/nix-config).

Start page is [Tabliss](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/).

Special thanks to [MrOtherGuy](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy) for the very helpful tutorials and [CSS code](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks)!
